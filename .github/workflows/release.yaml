            ## ðŸš¨ Not Mergeable: Changelog Update Required
            This is a release PR, waiting to be merged when a new release is ready.
            However, there are currently no changes that would be reflected in the Changelogâ€”meaning there are no updates significant enough to justify a new release.
            As a result, this PR is in a waiting state. Once a meaningful update is made and the Changelog is updated accordingly, this PR can be merged.
          success-message: |
            ## âœ… Mergeable: Changelog Updated
            New changes have been added and reflected in the Changelog, making this release PR ready to be merged.
            Please perform a final check, and if everything looks good, proceed with the merge.
